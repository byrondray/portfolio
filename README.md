## Product Principles

1. Friction is a bug. Reduce cognitive & interaction cost.
2. Motion should clarify, never decorate aimlessly.
3. Every surface earns its pixels.
4. Latency is an experience, not a number.
5. Defaults teach; ergonomics compound.

## Why This Exists

This site is a living record of things shipped, experiments tried, and ideas in motion. It favors signal over volume—curated rather than exhaustive.
