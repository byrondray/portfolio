## Snapshot

- Focus: Product-minded full‑stack developer & builder.
- Philosophy: Clarity first. Ship small, iterate fast, measure honestly.
- Superpowers: Systems thinking, interaction polish, pragmatic architecture.

## Product Principles

1. Friction is a bug. Reduce cognitive & interaction cost.
2. Motion should clarify, never decorate aimlessly.
3. Every surface earns its pixels.
4. Latency is an experience, not a number.
5. Defaults teach; ergonomics compound.

## Why This Exists

This site is a living record of things shipped, experiments tried, and ideas in motion. It favors signal over volume—curated rather than exhaustive.
